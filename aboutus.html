<p id="group"> We are a group of Kode with Klossy scholars and we are making this web page about international crises so that we can raise awareness and help solve them.
We each chose a topic that was close to our hearts and wrote a short explanation about the crises. The purpose of the page is raising awareness so that we can try making a difference in the world. </p>
